                Virtual events have become very popular after the COVID-19 pandemic. Before that, we preferred to do almost all of our organizations in a physical environment and face to face. Almost overnight, everyone started holding online meetings and hosting online events. That's when webinars became the most preferred method of organizing a virtual event. It can also be defined as an online meeting, digital conference, virtual event or video conference, which is usually broadcast live over the internet. Whatever the name, it brings together individuals from all over the world with one click, regardless of location. Of course, this one-click is for the viewers. When it comes to organizers, there are many clicks needed to host an efficient webinar. So let's start with two questions: What is a webinar? How does it work? Let's explore how the webinar is done in Q&A format…

                What is a webinar?
                </h2>
                
                <p>
                Webinar is a mix of the words 'web' and 'seminar'. It is an event, video presentation, workshop, conference, training session, or classroom lecture delivered online using webinar software. It is an event held virtually and attended by an online-only audience. There are other terms used as alternatives to webinar: web event, online seminar, web lecture, and virtual event.

                <p>
                A webinar allows speaker(s) anywhere to share presentations, videos, multimedia content or other free resources with audiences located anywhere.

                </h2>
                
                <p>
                No, a webinar is not a webcast. Webcasts are pre-recorded sessions that broadcast online, while webinars are live sessions that allow real-time interaction between the presenter and attendees.

                A webinar has audio and visual components. The visual portion is shared with a web conferencing tool. The audio portion is broadcast over the phone or via the audience's computers.

                <p>
                Yeah! What makes it effective is that it is a two-way form of communication where attendees and presenters communicate, receive and share information with each other in real time.
